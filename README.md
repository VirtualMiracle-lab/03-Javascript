# 01 PROJECT OPERATION

This project was a text to see how we would react to basic javascript. Creating variables and implementing them into a for loop to create a password generator. I had to create a prompt to ask how long they would want the password and depending on the inputted answer it would continue through to the confirm messages. 


## PROJECT USES


The use of this project was to create a random password generator. 


## GETTING STARTED

To get started I had to go through some out of class javascript lessons on Youtube and activities that we did in class. It was a real challenge and I certainly had a hard time with completing this assignment. 

## GETTING HELP

To get help with this assignment I went to the previous activities and Youtube videos.
